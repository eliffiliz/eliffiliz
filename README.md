## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering graduate with a strong interest in software development and artificial intelligence. My academic and project experience focuses on computer vision, deep learning, and data-driven problem solving. I enjoy working on real-world problems, especially those related to autonomous systems and image processing.

I have experience combining **deep learning models** with **classical methods** to build robust and interpretable solutions. I am motivated to continuously improve my technical skills and contribute to impactful projects.
